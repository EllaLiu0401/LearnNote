# Tips

- React can’t mutate state, just create a new item.
- **Event Object and Parameter Passing**
    - **Event Object**: In an event handler function, when an event (such as click or submit) occurs, the browser **automatically passes an event object** to the handler. This is the standard behavior of DOM events.
    - **Parameter Passing**: When you need to pass custom parameters to the event handler function, you must use an arrow function or another method to ensure that the **parameters are passed** when the event occurs, not immediately during rendering.
        
        `<button *onClick***=**{() **=>** onDeleteItem(item**.***id*)}>❌</button>`
        
- When sort an array, use `.slice` first and then use `sort`. Make sure the array is not mutated.
- Vscode can refactor component to a file automatically.
- Use Cases for **Guard Clauses**：
    - **Validation**: Checking if function inputs meet certain criteria before proceeding.
    - **Preconditions**: Ensuring necessary conditions are met before executing the main logic.
    - **Error Handling**: Handling errors or exceptional cases early.
        
        **`if** (**!**name **||** **!**image) **return;**`
        
- Command + mouse click will go to the function it clicked
- Use `Array.from()` more to get duplicated items.
- Use more **default value** in component function definition to avoid errors.
- Use **short circuit** more.
- Because use `React.StrictMode`, the console will get 2 logs.
- Think some occasion of user that the data isn’t fetched.
- Handle error: no Internet connection
- Make sure to **clean up** after fetch request in case in a situation that many requests can be fired off very rapidly.
- Don’t forget to **clear** the addeventlistener if use it
- 页面一直加载考虑useEffect
- 多使用&& rather than if
